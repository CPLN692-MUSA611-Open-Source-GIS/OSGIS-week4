/* =====================
  Lab 2, part3: a full application

  We're going to use the skills we've just been practicing to write a full application
  which is responsive to user input.
  At your disposal are a set of variables which we use to track user input (see
  part3-main.js and part3-setup.js for more details on how this is done â€” we'll
  cover this topic at a later date). Their values will be logged to console to
  aid in debugging.

  In this lab, which is very much open-ended, your task is to use the value of
  these variables to define the functions below. Try to come up with interesting
  uses of the provided user input.

  Some ideas:
    There are two numeric fields: can you write this application to filter
    using both minimum and maximum?
    There is a boolean (true/false) field: can you write your code to filter according
    to this boolean? (Try to think about how you could chop up this data to make this meaningful.)
    There is a string field: can you write your code to filter/search based on user
    input?

  Remember, this is open-ended. Try to see what you can produce.

  return myMarkers.map(marker => map.removeLayer(marker));

  Define a getAndParseData function to grab our dataset through a jQuery.ajax call ($.ajax). It
  will be called as soon as the application starts. Be sure to parse your data once you've pulled
  it down!

  displayData = _.filter(displayData, function (item) {return filterString(item, stringField.toUpperCase())});
  displayData = _.filter(displayData, function (item) {return filterBool(item)});

  var makeMarkers = function(data) { 
    return displayData.map(item => L.marker([item.Y, item.X]) ) ;
